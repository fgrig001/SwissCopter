SwissCopter
===========

SwissCopter is a quad copter controller that is currently being prototyped using an Arduino Uno and an MPU-6050 IMU breakout board. The code will eventualy be ported to an AVR baised board that is currently in development. 

##### We curently have three working directories: 
  * Archive: The original SwissCopter code that was developed as a quick-and-dirty solution with a short turnaround time. We will be starting our development using these as refrences and as a basis for improvment. 
  * ArduinoDev: The prototyping of the controller code will take place here. 
  * AVRDev: The final project code with reside here.
