SwissCopter
===========

SwissCopter is a quad copter controller that is currently being prototyped using an Arduino Uno and an MPU-6050 IMU breakout board. The code will eventually be ported to an AVR based board that is currently in development.

##### We currently have three working directories:
  * Archive: The original SwissCopter code that was developed as a quick-and-dirty solution with a short turnaround time. We will be starting our development using these as references and as a basis for improvement.
  * ArduinoDev: The prototyping of the controller code will take place here.
  * AVRDev: The final project code with reside here.
